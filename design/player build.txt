how to read this:
"-" before something means it will cost points to add to your character (benefits)
"+" before something means it will give points to your character build (detriments)

default attributes:

build = {
	"Melee damage" = {
		description = "Points in this category affect damage dealt from melee range.",
		enabled = false,
		children = {
			"Double damage" = {
				enabled = false,
				description = "this doubles a characterâ€™s melee damage"
			}
			"Half mana cost" = {
				enabled = false,
				description = ""
			}
		}
	}
}
